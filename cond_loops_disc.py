### This is the syntax of a for-loop ###

#for variable in range(start, stop, step):
    # Code block to be executed

### This is the syntax of a while-loop ###

#while condition == true:
    # Code block to be executed


# Note: It is normal to forget the syntax! That is why google is your bff and you just need to google "for loop syntax" or "while loop syntax"
# and there are tons of resources. I usually just go to images to quickly check the syntax.


'''### Problem 1: Your turn!

Print i 10 times using both a for and while loop.'''
# for loop bellow
i = any 
while  i = any
print(i**10)
i-=i

#while loop below
for i in range(i,i+1)
print(i)



'''###Problem 2: Range()
Range is a cool function but there are a lot of parts to it so let's disect it!

What happens if the range is from (5, 5)?  How about from (10, 6)?  
Try different step sizes: (10, 6, -1), (1, 10, 2). Write down all your observations and answer the following questions.'''

#YOUR CODE HERE
range(5, 5)
len(range(5, 5))
